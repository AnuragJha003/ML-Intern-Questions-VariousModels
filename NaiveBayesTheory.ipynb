    "2. Advantages\n",
    "Work Very well with many number of features\n",
    "Works Well with Large training Dataset\n",
    "It converges faster when we are training the model\n",

    "5. Impact of Missing Values?\n",
    "Naive Bayes can handle missing data. Attributes are handled separately by the algorithm at both model construction time and prediction time. As such, if a data instance has a missing value for an attribute, it can be ignored while preparing the model, and ignored when a probability is calculated for a class value tutorial :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjyLfpv5oA\n",
